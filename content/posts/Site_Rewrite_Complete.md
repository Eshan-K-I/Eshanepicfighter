The site rewrite is complete! It went through many phases of being written in various different languages. It first started of in ReactJS, then Angular, then ReactJS, and finally <a href="https://www.gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. Its been an absolute blast learning Javascript and Sass to make a professional-esque blog site. Thanks to <a href="https://www.gohugo.io">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> for making anyone be able to make a free, high quality, secure, and open-source website.
