Execute\n docker pull hello-world docker run hello-world  It should print hello world with some additional content. Then execute\n docker rm hello-world  Step 3: Run the Minecraft Server To run the minecraft server, execute\n docker pull itzg/minecraft-server docker run -d -v /path/on/host:/data \\ -e TYPE=PAPER \\ -p 25565:25565 -e EULA=TRUE --name mc itzg/minecraft-server  Your Minecraft server should be availible at the ip address of your Docker server\n","permalink":"https://eshanepicfighter.github.io/Eshanepicfighter/posts/minecraft_server_on_docker_guide/","summary":"This guide NOT for beginners.
